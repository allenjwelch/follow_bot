## Testing and Assembly
The chassis kit includes instructions so the assembly was fairly straight forward, however the 4 AA battery pack didnt not supply enough power and had to substituted for a 6 AA battery pack.

To attach additional analong sensors to the motor shield, you will need to solder on additional header connectors to the open A0-A5 pin holes. The rocker switch will also have to be connected to the battery pack to supply power to the Arduino.
